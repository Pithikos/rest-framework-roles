1.0.0
=====

This version is a major refactoring to only support latest DRF and ease future maintenace, plus ensuring least privilege by default.

Dropped features
  - Officially only support DRF (vanilla Django might still work fine but not thoroughly tested)
  - Totally drop support for function-based views
  - Totally drop support for 'allowed' and 'disallowed' decorators

New features
  - Least privileges by default
  - Grouping views in view_permissions
  - Caching in redirections so same checks never occur twice
  - Too deep redirections now detected and will throw exception

Changes
  - Rename setting 'roles' to 'ROLES'
  - Now permission_classes and view_permissions are mutually exclusive in view classes
  - Framework now patches DRF's DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES with DenyAll


0.4.1
=====

  - Support for Django 3
  - Support for Django REST Framework
  - Support both class-based and function-based views
